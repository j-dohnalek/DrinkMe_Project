# DrinkMe
Drink Me - Solution to tackle dehydratation between people suffering with dementia. The idea to this started in March 2017 when I have joined a university based hackathon Hacking Health.

## Idea
One of the issues for people with dementia is the limited short term memory capacity. The memory problem can lead to forgetting to drink leading to reduced water intake and dehydration. The dehydration leads to further problems often leading to hospitalisation.

## Proposed Solution
The solution to this problem would be a talking coaster. The coaster would speak to the person reminding them to drink. The product would support handling of drinking cold and warm drinks.
